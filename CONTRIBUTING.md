---

## 📌 How to Contribute

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

If you haven't already, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

### 2️⃣ Always Pull the Latest Changes
Before you start working, make sure your local copy is up to date:
```bash
git pull origin main
```

### 3️⃣ Create a New Branch (Recommended)
Work on a separate branch for each feature, bugfix, or task:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```
### 4️⃣ Make Your Changes
Add, edit, or delete files as needed.

### 5️⃣ Add and Commit Your Changes
After making changes, stage and commit them:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Brief description of your changes"
```

### 6️⃣ Push Your Branch to GitHub
```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```
### 7️⃣ Create a Pull Request (PR)
Go to the GitHub repository → Pull requests tab → New pull request.
Compare your branch with main, add a title and description, and submit the PR.

### 8️⃣ Review and Merge
Once the PR is approved, it can be merged into main.
📌 Always pull the latest main before starting new work.
```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```
### 📖 Direct Push to main
If you're making small changes and no one else is working at the same time, you may push directly to main after pulling the latest changes.
```bash
git pull origin main
git add .
git commit -m "Your message"
git push origin main
```
⚠️ Avoid doing this if possible. Use branches and PRs for clean collaboration.

## 📌 Code of Conduct
Be respectful and collaborative.

Write clear and meaningful commit messages.

Keep the main branch stable and working.

Pull before pushing to avoid conflicts.
